Player Description:
Built decades ago this church was a local gathering spot for worship of the various deities within the pantheon. One day there was an earthquake and it split open a hole just in front of the main dais. While it was used for a time after that it has since fallen into disrepair and has been abandoned. The locals have since claimed that the church is haunted but something far worse has been awoken in the caves beneath the church. 

GM Description:
Beneath the church a small system of caves has opened up as the result of a portal being opened by a mad wizard. The portal shifts in its connections to different planes, however it *generally* connects to the elemental planes but not always. The church just happened to be built above a thin spot between the realms and as a result when the mad wizard opened his portal the spell found the easiest place to punch through and this was the result. 


NPCs:
* Ghost of the Last Priest
	* He has forgotten most of what he knew in life and now just roams the grounds. 
	* Sometimes he gives sermons. Sometimes he recites poetry.  
* Spider Mother
	* She moved into one of the caves after the Church was abandoned. While generally not aggressive she will protect her clutch of eggs.
	* She can speak a broken common language, this is the result of her exposure to the portal

| Main Church                   | Entry Way:<br><br>- The entry alcove of the church is barren. The roof overhead has been eaten away by years of neglect. Where there were once tapestries on the walls venerating the various gods only dark spots remain in contrast to the sun bleached walls<br><br>Main Room:<br><br>- This large room once held local congregations of various gods. Anything of value long since ransacked away. The roof is holey and beams of light illuminate the dust that hangs in the air. Two support pillars have fallen and the stained glass windows have been shattered. What remains is dilapidated or destroyed. Two statues flank the entry way are all that remains of pantheon of gods celebrated here. | Ghost of the Last Priest |
