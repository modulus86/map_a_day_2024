The goal here is to make a dungeon per day. Dungeon is very loose, this could be generic Point of Interest on a map vs a real dungeon.

These will be designed in DungeonDraft for the map and notes will be created in Obsidian. The goal is to be *generally* system agnostic, however they will all tend towards fantasy. Won't necessarily use a random table to generate what type of dungeon/PoI this will be however they may be used to influence what is created.

I doubt any of these will be 100% complete, but a good enough outline should be provided to use in an adventure.

Every dungeon will include a few of the following:
* A map
* A general description/lore
* Some encounters and/or puzzles
* reward and loot ideas / concepts
* 1d4+2 Rooms

Other than minor grammar or spelling mistakes I will not be updating the maps/dungeons after their creation day as a result some will be incomplete, however there should be enough for a baseline to use in the future.
