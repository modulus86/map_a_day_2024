General Description:
Built roughly one hundred years ago the Inn on the Mountain to serve as a way station for those about to pass through the treacherous passages and crags. The stone of the mountain proved too hard to cut after the first few feet as a result the inn was formed around the cliffs and a sinkhole provided a good spot for the larder.
